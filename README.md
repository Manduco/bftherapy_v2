# BF Therapy - Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Landing Page

## Objective
BF Therapy is a simple web application designed for a client providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) services, specifically targeting individuals with Autism. The goal of this project is to offer a clean, informative, and accessible landing page for potential clients and visitors to learn about ABA therapy and its benefits.

## Features
- **Home Page:** A welcoming landing page introducing visitors to the services offered.
- **ABA & Autism:** A section dedicated to explaining ABA therapy and its impact on Autism.
- **Resources:** A curated list of helpful resources for parents and caregivers.
- **About Us:** Information about the client and their ABA practice.
- **Contact Form:** A contact form that allows visitors to submit inquiries directly to the adminâ€™s email. Spam checks and bot prevention will be implemented to ensure valid submissions.

## Current Status
This project is currently in **version 2**, where the focus is on enhancing the user experience by moving from basic HTML, CSS, and PHP to a more robust tech stack including ASP.NET and Bootstrap. 

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Bootstrap for responsive design
- **Backend:**
  - ASP .NET Framework (exploring replacement of PHP)
  - PHP (temporarily used for contact form submissions)
  - Considering Node.js for future backend needs
- **Hosting:** Hosted on HostGator with the domain name registered through GoDaddy.
  
## Future Enhancements
- Replace PHP-based form submission with a more secure and scalable backend solution, possibly using Node.js or ASP.NET.
- Automate lead management by pushing form data into an SQL server and sending email reminders to admins.
- Additional bot prevention and spam-check mechanisms on the server side.

## How to Run
Currently, the project can be cloned and run locally using any web server. PHP is required for form submissions. As development progresses, instructions for deploying the ASP.NET version will be updated.
